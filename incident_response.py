# Ensure you capture the output and convert it to text!
# YOUR CODE HERE:

# TASK 2: Parse the captured output to extract ONLY the attacking IP addresses.
# Hint: Loop through each line, split the line by spaces, and grab index [10].
# Save the IPs to a Python List called attacker_ips.
# YOUR CODE HERE:
# Turn the text block into a list of individual lines
